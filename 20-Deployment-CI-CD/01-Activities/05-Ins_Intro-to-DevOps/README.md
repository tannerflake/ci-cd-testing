# How to Write a Technical Design Document

## Problem

* This section is **required**.

* Focus on a specific problem.

  * Ask what the problem **is** and tell the story around that.

## Current Process

* This section is **optional** but recommended.

* What is the current process?

  * What is working well? Why?

  * What isn't working well? Why?

  * Do you know how things are done? Does your team or company know?

* Be as thorough as you can, and list questions that come up during your research. Answer those questions.

* This section can help identify decisions made outside your control and scope—for example, organizational choices made by the company or team.

## Requirements

* This section is **optional**.

* List of requirements the solution has to meet:

  * Business Requirements
    * What do we care about?
    * What don't we want?
    * Where should the focus be?
    * Ease of use
  * Company Guidelines
    * Price
    * Works with the existing stack
  * Etc.

* This section will help us quickly eliminate specific solutions before we dive too deep.

## Solution

* This section is **required**.

* Don't settle on the first solution you find. Look at multiple options.

* Once you have weighed the options, give the suggested solution and its reasoning.

* Present the solution using an existing problem-solving strategy, such as the Three Ws of Strategy.

* A solution doesn't have to be a specific technology. Often, the solution is a culture or mindset shift.
