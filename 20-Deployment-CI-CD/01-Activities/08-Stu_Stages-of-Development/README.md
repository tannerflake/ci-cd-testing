# üêõ Implement Proper Branching Practices and Deploy App

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* As a DevOps engineer, I would like to apply proper branching practices to my company's application so that it will be more difficult to deploy broken code.

## Expected Behavior

* When I visit the URL for the application, it should be available and working correctly.

* When I attempt to push new code changes to `main`, I am notified that I must create a Pull Request to merge new content into `main`.

## Actual Behavior

* When I push new code changes, I can push straight to `main`.

* When I visit the URL for the application, nothing happens.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. Copy the given code into your deployed Word-Guess application.

2. Push the new code into `main`.

3. Wait for the app to deploy.
