# Deployment Process Does Not Include Automated Testing

## Problem

The current deployment process does not include automated testing, which leads to code being pushed to production without verification. This lack of testing can result in bugs and errors being introduced to the live environment, negatively impacting the application's reliability and user experience.

* Focus on a specific problem.

  * Ask what the problem **is** and tell the story around that.

## Current Process

* This section is **optional** but recommended.

* What is the current process?

  * What is working well? Why?

  * What isn't working well? Why?

  * Do you know how things are done? Does your team or company?

* Be as thorough as you can, and list questions that come up during your research. Answer those questions.

* This section can help identify decisions made outside your control and scope—for example, organizational choices made by the company or team.

## Requirements

* This section is **optional**.

* List of requirements the solution has to meet. Requirements such as:

  * Business Requirements
    * What do we care about?
    * What don't we want?
    * Where should the focus be?
    * Ease of use
  * Company Guidelines
    * Price
    * Works with the existing stack
  * Etc.

* This section will help us quickly eliminate specific solutions before we dive too deep.

## Solution

* This section is **required**.

* Don't settle on the first solution you find. Look at multiple options.

* Once you have weighed the options, give the suggested solution and its reasoning.

* Present the solution using an existing problem-solving strategy, such as the Three W's of Strategy.

* A solution doesn't have to be a specific technology. Often, the solution is a culture or mindset shift.
